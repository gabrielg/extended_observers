= extended_observers

I needed to use an observer to observe multiple models, but only wanted to observe certain sets of changes on each one. There was also a bug where calling observe twice in an ActiveRecord Observer would clear out any previous list of observed classes. This patch adds both the :on option and refactors the workings of the observe method to not clear out models from previous declarations
